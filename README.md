# 32-BIT-ALU
A 32 bit ALU performing multiple operations (ADD-MULTIPLY-SQRT-COMPARE)
32-BIT ALU SCHEMATIC

The multiplier and the SQRT blocks were constructed using a parameterized model in quartus prime which are easy to pipeline
The Add32 was constructed using schematic capture (which is not the best way to do it in terms of efficiency and pipelining)
The rest of the blocks were made using a VHDL code
